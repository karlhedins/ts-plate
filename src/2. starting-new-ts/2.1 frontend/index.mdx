# Frontend

Here are a few starter projects to get your TypeScript frontend project going:

a.k.a "I just want to start coding in TS with a click". Straight in the browser with a web version of VS Code ðŸ™Œ

## React - create-react-app 2

As of October 29, 2018, the extremely popular starter project from the Facebook React team released the long awaited version 2 of it's tool with TypeScript support.
Packed with all the latest goodies [see the blogpost](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/01/create-react-app-v2.html) it is a great starter for React apps. To create a CRA-app run the following:

```bash
yarn create react-app your-app-name-goes-here
```

## Vue

V3.0 will be written in TypeScript - opt in for users - but the TypeScript variant will naturally give a great TS experience out of the box.
