# Frontend

Here are a few starter projects to get your TypeScript frontend project going:

## Stackblitz Blank Typescript project

a.k.a "I just want to start coding in TS with a click". Straight in the browser with a web version of VS Code ðŸ™Œ

## React - create-react-app 2

As of October 01, 2018, the extremely popular starter project from the Facebook React team released the long awaited version 2 of it's tool.
Packed with all the latest goodies [see the blogpost](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/01/create-react-app-v2.html) it is a great starter for React apps.
For extra icing on the cake for TypeScript enthusiast, on October 22 a [PR got merged](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/4837) into master that adds TypeScript support as opt in for CRA. As of October 26 it is yet to be released - so keep an eye out for that. Until then - here's how you can use it out today:

Go to the CRA repo and clone it

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

In the CRA root:

```bash
yarn install
```

navigate into the /packages/react-scripts folder and create a yarn link to it:

```bash
yarn link
```

Then:

```bash
cd ~/your/projects/folder
npx create-react-app app-name
cd app-name
```

Use the yarn link you just created to `react-scripts`

```
yarn link react-scripts
yarn install
```

Finally follow the guide for setting up TypeScript:

## React - react-scripts-ts

Aiming to be a more "TypeScript-y" fork of CRA. This project does not seem as active as it was before.

## React & Redux + Static Typing Guide

An overall fantastic guide on type safe React and Redux usage. Links go some great libraries.

## Vue

V3.0 will be written in TypeScript - opt in for users - but the TypeScript variant will naturally give a great TS experience out of the box.
